Initialize a hash map to store the frequency of each element.

Iterate through the array:

For each element, update its frequency in the hash map.

After processing the array, find the element with the maximum frequency.

Return the element with the highest frequency.

public class MaxFrequencyElement {

    // Function to find the element with maximum frequency
    public static int findMaxFrequencyElement(int[] arr) {
        // Step 1: Create a hash map to store the frequency of each element
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Step 2: Count the frequency of each element
        for (int num : arr) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Step 3: Find the element with maximum frequency
        int maxFrequency = 0;
        int maxElement = arr[0]; // Initialize with the first element
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : frequencyMap.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() > maxFrequency) {
                maxFrequency = entry.getValue();
                maxElement = entry.getKey();
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Return the element with the highest frequency
        return maxElement;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example array
        int[] arr = {3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 3};

        // Find the element with the maximum frequency
        int result = findMaxFrequencyElement(arr);

        // Print the result
        System.out.println("Element with maximum frequency: " + result);
    }
}
Explanation of the Example:
Given the array arr = {3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 3}, we need to find the element that appears the most frequently:

We first count the frequency of each element:

3 appears 3 times.

1 appears 1 time.

4 appears 2 times.

2 appears 1 time.

The element with the highest frequency is 3 with a frequency of 3.

So, the result is 3.

Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity:

O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We traverse the array once to build the frequency map and then iterate over the map (which has at most n entries) to find the element with the highest frequency.

Space Complexity:

O(n), since we store the frequencies of all distinct elements in the hash map. In the worst case, where all elements are distinct, the space complexity will be proportional to the number of elements n.
