Base Case:

Initialize an array count[] where count[i] stores the number of 1s in the binary representation of i.

Iterate from 1 to n:

For each number i, use the relation:

If i is even: count[i] = count[i / 2]

If i is odd: count[i] = 1 + count[i / 2]

Sum up all count[i] values for i from 0 to n.

Return the result.

üîç Example
Let n = 5.

We will count the number of 1s in the binary representations of the numbers from 0 to 5:

0 = 000 (0 ones)

1 = 001 (1 one)

2 = 010 (1 one)

3 = 011 (2 ones)

4 = 100 (1 one)

5 = 101 (2 ones)

Now, summing the number of 1s in all binary representations:

Edit
0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7
Output:

Total number of 1s in binary representations from 0 to 5: 7
‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity:

We iterate from 1 to n and calculate the number of 1s for each number in constant time. Hence, the time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:

We use an array count[] of size n + 1 to store the number of 1s for each number from 0 to n. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).
